# Handle incoming notifications: Web

By default, the Beams web SDK will always display a notification when one arrives and will open a new tab based on the `deep_link` property provided in the publish payload. We offer two different methods of customizing this behavior.

## Overriding default SDK behavior

If you would like to take complete control of how notifications are handled and displayed, you can provide a custom `onNotificationReceived` handler. This will be triggered when a notification arrives and will disable the default SDK behavior.

```js
importScripts("https://js.pusher.com/beams/service-worker.js");

PusherPushNotifications.onNotificationReceived = ({ pushEvent, payload }) => {
  // NOTE: Overriding this method will disable the default notification
  // handling logic offered by Pusher Beams. You MUST display a notification
  // in this callback unless your site is currently in focus
  // https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/subscribing-a-user#uservisibleonly_options

  // Your custom notification handling logic here 🛠️
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/showNotification
  pushEvent.waitUntil(
    self.registration.showNotification(payload.notification.title, {
      body: payload.notification.body,
      icon: payload.notification.icon,
      data: payload.data,
    })
  );
};
```

## Adding additional custom logic, keeping default behavior

If you would like to add custom logic when a notification arrives but still make use of the default implementation, you can call the `handleNotification` callback in your `onNotificationReceived` handler. For example, you could choose to only call `handleNotification` when your site isn't in focus.

```js
importScripts("https://js.pusher.com/beams/service-worker.js");

PusherPushNotifications.onNotificationReceived = ({
  pushEvent,
  payload,
  handleNotification,
}) => {
  // Your custom notification handling logic here 🛠️
  // This method triggers the default notification handling logic offered by
  // the Beams SDK. This gives you an opportunity to modify the payload.
  // E.g. payload.notification.title = "A client-determined title!"
  pushEvent.waitUntil(handleNotification(payload));
};
```
