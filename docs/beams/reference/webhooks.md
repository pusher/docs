## `v1.UserNotificationAcknowledgement`

Sent when a notification is reported as delivered by a user's device. This gives you insight into whether notifications are making it to the device from the platform gateway. For example, this will help you detect when notifications are dropped by the OS (as they are on certain flavors of Android). Some devices will receive the notification but not report back an acknowledgement because of internet connectivity issues or various operating system limitations.

This webhook requires that the target device be running at least one of the following SDK versions:

- iOS - `1.3.0`
- Android - `1.4.0`

| `instance_id` | string | ID of the Pusher Beams instance that triggered this event.  |
| `publish_id`  | string | Unique ID of the publish request that triggered this event. |
