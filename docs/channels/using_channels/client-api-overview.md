# Client API overview

The Client API Overview provides information on how to perform specific actions using our [client libraries](/docs/channels/channels_libraries/libraries). Where possible each section provides an overview of the action, a reference-style guide to the constructor, property or method and an example of how it is used.

The reference-style guide and examples may contain information for different languages. You can choose which language you wish to view by clicking on the appropriate tab as below.

{% snippets ['js', 'swift', 'objc', 'java', 'laravelecho', 'c'] %}

var pusher = new Pusher("YOUR_APP_KEY", options);

let pusher = Pusher(key: "YOUR_APP_KEY")
```
